# Tidy Data

## Rules for Tidy Data
The concept of tidy data can be attributed to Hadley Wickham and has three principles for organizing data. [Tidy Data Reference](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

1. Each variable must have its own column,
2. Each observation must have its own row, and
3. Each value must have its own cell.

## Why use Tidy Data

*Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. - Hadley Wickham*

- Storing data in a consistent way gives familiarity with methods for manipulating data.
- Tidy data structure takes advantage of vectorised operations in R
- Many useful packages: such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2` require tidy data.


# Baltimore Towing Data

## An Overview
The first example focuses on a subset of a dataset that contains information on vehicles towed in Baltimore, MD:

- A larger version of this dataset along with additional descriptions can be found at:  [https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/DOT-Towing/k78j-azhn](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/DOT-Towing/k78j-azhn). 

- The full version of the dataset contains 61,000 rows and 36 columns, where each row corresponds to a vehicle and the columns are information pertaining to the vehicle.

- We will be working with a smaller dataset with approximately 30,000 rows and 5 columns.

## The dataset
First read in the data set which is available at: [http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/BaltimoreTowing.csv](http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/BaltimoreTowing.csv).
```{r, message = F}
baltimore.tow <- 
  read_csv('http://www.math.montana.edu/ahoegh/teaching/stat408/datasets/BaltimoreTowing.csv')
str(baltimore.tow)
```

## Information for a few vehicles

```{r, echo = F}
kable(head(baltimore.tow, 8))
```

# dplyr package

## dplyr package
We have a set of tools to complete the analysis, but we are going to use a packaged called `dplyr` to do the data transformation and aggregation for this problem.

There is a [information page](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) on the functionality of `dplyr`.

## Motivating Exercise: group_by()

Now compute the average towing cost grouped by month.

## Not Solution: group_by()

Now compute the average towing cost grouped by month.

```{r, eval = F}
baltimore.tow %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean.cost = mean(totalPaid))
```

## tibbles 

- tibbles are a modern rethinking of data.frame() in R.
- tibbles can be coerced into a data.frame with `as.data.frame()`
- tibbles only print first 10 rows when printing and also includes column report type

# Data Wrangling

## Data Wrangling
As a statistician or more generally a data scientist the ability to manipulate, process, clean, and merge datasets is an essential skill. 

- These skills are generally referred to as data wrangling or munging.
- In a data analysis or visualization setting, they will undoubtedly require a majority of your time.
- Wrangling data can be a painful process.
- This lecture will provide some tools and example of organizing data.

## Data Wrangling Concepts

- Dealing with strings
- Dealing with date/time objects
- Wide and thin datasets


## Motivating Exercise: group_by()

Now compute the average towing cost grouped by month.


```{r}
kable(head(baltimore.tow, 4))
```


##  `substr()` function
Consider adding a column for year to the data set. This can be done using `substr().`

*Usage*: substr(x, start, stop)

*Arguments*: 

- x, text	a character vector.
- start, first integer. The first element to be extracted
- stop, last integer. The last element to be extracted

## Exercise: Using the substr() function
Use the substr() function to extract month and create a new variable in R. 

## Solution: Using the substr() function
Use the substr() function to extract month and create a new variable in R. 

```{r}
baltimore.tow$month <- substr(baltimore.tow$receivingDateTime,0,2)
head(baltimore.tow$month)
```

## Motivating Exercise: group_by()

Now compute the average towing cost grouped by month.

```{r, warning = F}
baltimore.tow %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean.cost = mean(totalPaid))
```

## strsplit() function
In many situations, the year could be in a different position so the `substr()` might not work. For example month the date could be coded `4/1/2015` rather than `04/01/2015` So consider, using `strsplit()` instead.

*Usage*: strsplit(x, split)

*Arguments*:

- x: character vector, each element of which is to be split. Other inputs, including a factor, will give an error.
- split: character vector (or object which can be coerced to such) containing regular expression(s) (unless fixed = TRUE) to use for splitting. 

## Exercise: Using the strsplit() function
Use the strsplit() function to remove the dollar sign from the cost.

## Solution: Using the strsplit() function
Use the strsplit() function to remove the dollar sign from the cost.

```{r}
## example for one row
strsplit(baltimore.tow$totalPaid[1],'$', fixed = T)[[1]][2]
```


## Stringr Package
The `stringr` package ([cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/strings.pdf)) provides a nice set of tools. There is also an [information page](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/from-base.html).



## Exercise: Stringr approach
Use the `stringr` package to remove (replace) the dollar sign. Note that a dollar sign is a special character, so you'll need to use `\\$`.

## Solution: Stringr approach
Use the `stringr` package to remove (replace) the dollar sign
```{r}
library(stringr)
baltimore.tow$cost <- as.numeric(str_replace(baltimore.tow$totalPaid, '\\$',''))
```

## Motivating Exercise: group_by()

Now compute the average towing cost grouped by month.

```{r}
baltimore.tow %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarize(mean.cost = mean(cost))
```


## lubridate package

lubridate is a tidyverse package for manipulating date objects. There is a nice [website](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org).

## Date objects for Baltimore tow

```{r, message=F}
library(lubridate)
class(baltimore.tow$receivingDateTime)
baltimore.tow <- baltimore.tow %>% 
  mutate(date_time = mdy_hms(receivingDateTime))
class(baltimore.tow$date_time)
```


## Date objects for Baltimore tow

```{r}
head(month(baltimore.tow$date_time))
head(year(baltimore.tow$date_time))
```



# Goal 2. Type of Vehicles Towed by Month


## Goal 2. Type of Vehicles Towed by Month
Next we wish to compute how many vehicles were towed for each vehicle type

However, we want to take a close look at the vehicle types in the data set and perhaps create more useful groups.

## Unique function - how to group vehicles
First examine the unique types of vehicles in this data set.

```{r}
unique(baltimore.tow$vehicleType)
```

## Grouping
First consider reasonable groups for vehicle types.

1. Cars - (Car, convertible)
2. Large Cars - (SUV, Station Wagon, Sport Utility Vehicle, Van, Taxi)
3. Trucks - (Pick-up Truck, Pickup Truck)
4. Large Trucks - (Truck, Tractor Trailer, Tow Truck, Tractor, Construction Equipment, Commercial Truck)
5. Bikes - (Motor Cycle (Street Bike), Dirt Bike, All terrain - 4 wheel bike, Mini-Bike)
6. Misc (delete) - (Boat, Golf Cart, Trailer)

## Messy Data: Grouping
Next examine values in some of these groups, we will just look at the vehicle type of 'Truck'.

```{r, mysize=TRUE, size='\\scriptsize', tidy=T}
unique(baltimore.tow$vehicleMake[baltimore.tow$vehicleType == 'Truck'])
```
\normalsize
Note that there are several spelling errors in this data set. How do we combine them?


## Messy Data: Data Cleaning
Spelling errors can be addressed, by reassigning vehicles to the correct spelling.
```{r}
baltimore.tow$vehicleMake[baltimore.tow$vehicleMake == 
                            'Peterbelt'] <- 'Peterbilt'
baltimore.tow$vehicleMake[baltimore.tow$vehicleMake == 
                            'Internantional'] <- 'International'
baltimore.tow$vehicleMake <-
  str_replace(baltimore.tow$vehicleMake,'Izuzu','Isuzu')
baltimore.tow$vehicleMake <-
  str_replace(baltimore.tow$vehicleMake,'Frightliner','Freightliner')
```
Also note that many of the groupings have mis-classified vehicles, but we will not focus on that yet.

## Exercise: Delete Misc. Type Vehicles

First we will delete golf carts, boats, and trailers. There are several ways to do this, consider making a new data frame called balt.tow.small that does not include golf carts, boats, and trailers.

## Solution: Delete Misc. Type Vehicles

First we will delete golf carts, boats, and trailers.

```{r}
balt.tow.small <- baltimore.tow %>% 
  filter(!vehicleType %in% c("Golf Cart",'Boat', 'Trailer'))
```


## Exercise: Create Additional Groups

Now we need to create a variable for the additional groups below.

1. Cars - (Car, convertible)
2. Large Cars - (SUV, Station Wagon, Sport Utility Vehicle, Van, Taxi)
3. Trucks - (Pick-up Truck, Pickup Truck)
4. Large Trucks - (Truck, Tractor Trailer, Tow Truck, Tractor, Construction Equipment, Commercial Truck)
5. Bikes - (Motor Cycle (Street Bike), Dirt Bike, All terrain - 4 wheel bike, Mini-Bike)


## Solution: Create Additional Groups

One way to create groups is by creating a new variable

```{r}
balt.tow.small$Group <- ''

balt.tow.small$Group[balt.tow.small$vehicleType %in% 
                       c('Car','Convertible')] <- 'Cars'

balt.tow.small$Group[balt.tow.small$vehicleType %in% c('SUV',
 'Station Wagon','Sport Utility Vehicle','Van','Taxi')] <- 'Large Cars'

balt.tow.small$Group[balt.tow.small$vehicleType %in% 
                       c('Pick-up Truck','Pickup Truck')] <- 'Trucks'

balt.tow.small$Group[balt.tow.small$vehicleType %in% 
    c('Truck','Tractor Trailer','Tow Truck','Tractor',
      'Construction Equipment','Commercial Truck')] <- 'Large Trucks'

balt.tow.small$Group[balt.tow.small$vehicleType %in% 
    c('Motor Cycle (Street Bike)','Dirt Bike','Mini-Bike',
      'All terrain - 4 wheel bike')] <- 'Bikes'
```


## Solution: dplyr
Next we wish to compute how many vehicles were towed for each vehicle type

```{r}
balt.tow.small %>% group_by(Group) %>% tally()
```
